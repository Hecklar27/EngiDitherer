# Technical Context - Minecraft Map Art Ditherer

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Primary Language: **Python**
**Rationale**: Optimal choice for this project because:
- Excellent image processing libraries (Pillow/PIL, NumPy)
- Simple GUI development with tkinter (built-in) or PyQt/tkinter
- Rapid prototyping and iteration for custom algorithm development
- Easy to package into standalone executable
- Strong community support for image processing tasks

### Core Libraries
1. **Pillow (PIL)**: Image loading, manipulation, and saving
2. **NumPy**: Efficient array operations for pixel data
3. **tkinter**: Built-in GUI framework (simple, no external dependencies)
4. **Optional**: PyQt5/6 for more advanced GUI features

### Alternative Considerations
- **Java**: Good choice but more verbose for image processing
- **C#**: Excellent for Windows GUI but less cross-platform
- **JavaScript/Electron**: Good for modern UI but overkill for this scope
- **C++**: Unnecessary complexity for single-image processing

## Development Environment
- Python 3.8+ (for compatibility)
- Virtual environment for dependency management
- IDE: VS Code, PyCharm, or similar

## Deployment Strategy
- Package as standalone executable using PyInstaller
- Single file distribution for easy sharing
- No installation required for end users
