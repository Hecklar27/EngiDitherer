# Active Context - Phase 1 Enhancement Complete

## Current Status: Phase 1 Enhanced - Duplicate Removal Added ✅

### Just Completed
Enhanced the `extract_colors.py` utility with robust duplicate removal functionality:
- **ACT files**: Removes duplicate color entries while preserving order
- **PNG files**: Handles both palette mode and unique color extraction with deduplication
- **TXT files**: Removes duplicate hex colors from text files
- **User feedback**: Shows count of duplicates removed during extraction
- **Comprehensive testing**: Verified functionality with test files

### Enhancement Details
- Added duplicate removal to all extraction methods
- Preserves original color order while removing duplicates
- Provides user feedback on how many duplicates were removed
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- All Phase 1 tests still pass with 100% success rate

### Current Focus
Phase 1 infrastructure is now complete and enhanced. Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Dithering Algorithm Implementation.

### Phase 1 Final Status
1. ✅ Set up Python project structure with virtual environment
2. ✅ Extract and organize all 61 Minecraft carpet color hex codes
3. ✅ Implement `palette.py` with color management functionality
4. ✅ Create color distance calculation functions (LAB color space)
5. ✅ Build `image_utils.py` for basic image loading
6. ✅ Write unit tests for color matching accuracy
7. ✅ **NEW**: Enhanced color extraction with duplicate removal

### Ready for Phase 2
All Phase 1 objectives completed successfully with enhancements. The foundation is solid and ready for dithering algorithm implementation.

### Next Phase 2 Goals
1. Implement custom Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm
2. Optimize error diffusion for Minecraft's limited palette
3. Add progress tracking for large images
4. Create command-line interface for testing
5. Performance benchmarking and optimization

### User Assets Available
- Enhanced color palette extraction utility (supports ACT, PNG, TXT with duplicate removal)
- 61 researched Minecraft carpet colors
- Complete testing framework
- Ready project structure

### Technical Foundation
- **Color Space**: LAB for perceptual accuracy
- **Architecture**: Modular MVC pattern
- **Performance**: NumPy-optimized operations
- **Compatibility**: Python 3.8+ with cross-platform support
- **Testing**: Automated test suite with comprehensive coverage
- **Enhancement**: Robust duplicate removal for all palette formats

### Immediate Focus
Implementing Phase 1: Core infrastructure and color palette management for the Minecraft map art dithering tool.

### Current Task
Setting up project structure and extracting Minecraft carpet color palette from user's color palette file.

### Phase 1 Goals
1. Set up Python project structure with virtual environment
2. Extract and organize all 61 Minecraft carpet color hex codes
3. Implement `palette.py` with color management functionality
4. Create color distance calculation functions (LAB color space)
5. Build `image_utils.py` for basic image loading
6. Write unit tests for color matching accuracy

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Language**: Python (for rapid development and excellent image processing libraries)
2. **GUI Framework**: tkinter (built-in, simple, no external dependencies)
3. **Architecture**: Modular design with separate concerns for GUI, processing, and color management
4. **Algorithm**: Custom Floyd-Steinberg variant optimized for Minecraft's limited carpet palette
5. **Color Space**: LAB for perceptually accurate color matching

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Help user extract hex codes from their color palette file
2. Create project directory structure
3. Set up requirements.txt and virtual environment
4. Implement color palette manager with extracted colors
5. Create basic color distance calculations

### User Assets Available
- Color palette file (format to be determined)
- Ready to proceed with implementation

### Pending Decisions
- Exact color distance calculation method (RGB vs LAB vs Delta E)
- GUI layout specifics (preview size, control placement)
- Image preprocessing requirements (resizing, format support)
- Error diffusion matrix weights for Minecraft optimization

### User Requirements Confirmed
- Single image processing
- Simple GUI application
- Custom algorithm for flat carpet palette
- Output: dithered image file
- Target: Java Edition flat maps
- User comfortable with all programming languages
