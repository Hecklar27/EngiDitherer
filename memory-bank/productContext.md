# Product Context - Minecraft Map Art Ditherer

## Problem Statement
Creating Minecraft map art is a complex process that requires converting regular images into a format that works with Minecraft's limited color palette. Current solutions either:
- Don't optimize for Minecraft's specific carpet color limitations
- Require technical knowledge to use effectively
- Don't provide real-time feedback during the conversion process
- Use generic dithering algorithms not suited for Minecraft's unique constraints

## Solution Overview
A specialized dithering tool that understands Minecraft's carpet block color palette and applies intelligent dithering algorithms optimized for map art creation.
